                      Hello Welcome to the NOAA Group with Adriana Solano and Sean Kotowich

I am Adriana Solano. I am Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University and will be graduating 
with my Bachelor's Degree in CS this May 1st, 2015.
My plans are to move to San Francisco California and apply to UC Berkley in order to continue pursuing my Master's Degree 
in the field of Computer Science. I am currently working as a front and back end developer with Dr. Maria Petrie at FAU. 
This experience has given me more knowledge related to web development and Database Administration, 
which is something that I am interested and passionate about.

Hello, my name is Sean Kotowich and I am a computer science major at Florida Atlantic University. I am planning to graduate this
coming december, and then continue my education by completing a computer engineering degree. Once I recieve my bachelors of
computer science I also plan to enter an internship locally.
